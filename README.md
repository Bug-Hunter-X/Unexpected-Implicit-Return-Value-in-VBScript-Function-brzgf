This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in VBScript: implicit return values from functions.  The `bug.vbs` file contains a function that incorrectly handles cases where the input is less than or equal to 10, resulting in an unexpected output. The `bugSolution.vbs` shows the corrected function with an explicit return statement for all execution paths, ensuring correct behavior.
